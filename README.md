# Algorithm Visualizer
Deployed at: https://marcuspearce.github.io/Algorithm-Visualizer/

Algorithm Visualizer is a web application which generates visualizations of common sorting and pathfinding algorithms. It is implemented using **React.js**, **SVG Animations**, **React-router**, **React Bootstrap**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and vanilla **JavaScript**. The website is deployed with **Github Pages**. 

My motivation to create this project was to provide a resource to help me teach my brother and friends these basic algorithms, as well as become more familiar with the React.js library.

### Implemented Algorithms:
* Pathfinding Algorithms
  * Dijkstra's Algorithm
* Sorting Algorithms
  * Bubble Sort
  * Selection Sort
  * Insertion Sort
  * Merge Sort

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
